Small Website Project with ASP.NET

This small website is created for practicing ASP.NET, Visual Studio and GitHub commands.

Please note that updates will be added to this site on the go and alternative versions will also appear such as similar projects with React and Angular. 

Thank you for reading my introductory notes.
